thoughts
went with scalatra - a sinatra style framework for scala.
got a form and a post page going in an hour.
had troubles with the generated code not working. lots of strange tools that load many things.
trying to figure out how akka works and fits in.

Language: Scala 
Problem Statement: 
App Category: Social Networking 
DB: None 
Simple part: 
- create a simple chat room application using scala 
- the chat room is a web app that allows multiple users to chat with each 
other in a conference 
- multiple users can join the chat room by providing a username. No 
authentication is done. The username is only required to identify the chat 
msg sender 
- all messages posted by a user is visible to all other users 
- Use Scala specific features to build the chat server. Use Actor class to 
receive messages. Explore how these are different from threads in 
conventional languages. Use Akka framework to create Actors. 
Complex part 1: (Optional, if you complete simple part and want to take up 
something more challenging) 
- Lets us start doing TDD from here on. Since it may be a relatively new 
concept to many, it is added as an optional portion 
- Use testing frameworks like ScalaTest to write test first for the 
application and then evolve the app code based on the test written
